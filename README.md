# LeetCode Solutions

A collection of my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented primarily in Python. This repository serves as a personal log of my journey in learning data structures and algorithms, documenting my approach and analysis for each problem I've solved.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

My solutions are organized into folders based on the primary data structure or algorithmic technique used to solve the problem. You can browse the folders to find solutions to different types of problems:

- `arrays/` - Solutions for problems involving arrays, sorting, and searching.
- `strings/` - Solutions for problems related to string manipulation and parsing.
- `linked-lists/` - Solutions for problems using singly or doubly linked lists.
- `trees/` - Solutions for problems involving binary trees, BSTs, and tree traversals.
- `graphs/` - Solutions for problems on graph theory, including DFS and BFS.
- `dynamic-programming/` - Solutions for problems that require a dynamic programming approach.

## üí° How I Use This Repository

This repository helps me keep track of my progress and serves as a reference for different problem-solving patterns. I hope it can also be a useful resource for others who are practicing LeetCode problems and want to see different solution approaches.
